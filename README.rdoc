= Welcome to Tr8n Translation Engine

Tr8n Translation Engine is a Rails Engine Plugin/Gem that provides a framework for crowd-sourced translation of any Rails based application. 
The power of the engine comes from its simple and friendly user interface that allows site users as well as professional translators to rapidly 
translate the site into hundreds of languages. The flexible and robust rules engine that powers Tr8n allows for any combination of language 
specific rules in any translatable sentence. Users can provide information on what sentences depend on gender rules, number rules or other rules configured for each language. 
The language specific context and case rules can be registered and managed for any language in the advanced user interface. The engine 
provides a set of powerful administration tools that allow admins to manage any aspect of the engine; enabling and disabling its features 
and monitoring translation progress.

The Tr8n engine itself is based on a very robust and flexible pluggable architecture where rule types and the syntax of the "tr" tokens 
can be configured or extended for any application deployment.

Tr8n translation engine has been successfully deployed by the following companies:

Geni Inc, http://www.geni.com
